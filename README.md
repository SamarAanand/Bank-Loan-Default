# 🏦 Bank Loan Default Prediction Project

## 📝 Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify potential loan defaulters for a consumer finance company. By analyzing historical loan data, the company seeks to understand the factors influencing loan defaults and mitigate credit losses.

## 💼 Business Understanding

- The company specializes in providing various types of loans to urban customers.
- Two types of risks associated with loan decisions:
  - Loss of business if a reliable applicant is rejected.
  - Financial loss if a defaulter is approved.
- Objectives include minimizing credit losses by identifying risky loan applicants and optimizing lending strategies.

## 📊 Data Understanding

- The dataset contains loan data from 2007 to 2011.
- Detailed data dictionary describing the meaning of variables is available.
- Various attributes such as applicant demographics, loan terms, and repayment status are included.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Understand driving factors behind loan default to enhance risk assessment.
- Develop predictive models to identify potential defaulters and optimize lending decisions.

## 📈 Analysis Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and transform existing ones.
4. **Model Building**: Select and train appropriate classification algorithms.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using relevant metrics.
6. **Interpretation**: Interpret model results and identify key predictors of loan default.
